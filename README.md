# Conclusion
As a data analyst,I had analyzed the game with number of  goals, assists, and other metrics, along with insights into player contributions and effectiveness.
Fabian Johnson and Christian Pulisic are the players who had scored more number of goals and they have more market value than all other players
A team can choose players with more height so that they can defend and attack effectively that obviously improves the team performance
Domestic league are played more than other type of competitions, instead away club matches can be played more to improve players exposure on various levels
